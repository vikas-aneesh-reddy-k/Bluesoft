# Supabase PostgreSQL Database Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for integrating Supabase PostgreSQL database into the "Will It Rain On My Parade?" weather prediction application. The database will provide persistent storage for user events, weather analysis caching, and historical data management to improve performance and enable advanced features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Setup and Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up Supabase PostgreSQL database so that the application can store and retrieve persistent data efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the database THEN the system SHALL create a new Supabase project with PostgreSQL database
2. WHEN configuring the database THEN the system SHALL enable PostGIS extension for geospatial data support
3. WHEN establishing connection THEN the system SHALL securely connect using environment variables for credentials
4. WHEN testing connection THEN the system SHALL verify database connectivity from both frontend and backend
5. IF connection fails THEN the system SHALL fallback gracefully to existing stateless operation

### Requirement 2: User Events Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my event planning data to be saved so that I can return to previous analyses and track my events over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user analyzes weather for an event THEN the system SHALL store the event details in the database
2. WHEN storing event data THEN the system SHALL include location coordinates, event date, event name, and analysis results
3. WHEN a user returns to the app THEN the system SHALL display their recent event analyses
4. WHEN viewing saved events THEN the system SHALL allow users to re-run analysis with updated data
5. IF user has no saved events THEN the system SHALL display an empty state with guidance

### Requirement 3: Weather Analysis Caching

**User Story:** As a user, I want weather analysis to load quickly so that I don't have to wait for repeated API calls for the same location and date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing weather analysis THEN the system SHALL check cache for existing results first
2. WHEN cache hit occurs THEN the system SHALL return cached results within 500ms
3. WHEN cache miss occurs THEN the system SHALL fetch fresh data and store in cache
4. WHEN cached data expires THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh with new API calls
5. IF cache storage fails THEN the system SHALL continue with direct API calls without error

### Requirement 4: Historical Weather Data Storage

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to store frequently accessed historical weather data locally so that we reduce dependency on external APIs and improve response times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching NASA historical data THEN the system SHALL store results in local database
2. WHEN storing historical data THEN the system SHALL include location, date, temperature, precipitation, and wind data
3. WHEN requesting historical data THEN the system SHALL check local storage before external APIs
4. WHEN local data is available THEN the system SHALL use it to reduce API calls by 80%
5. IF local data is outdated THEN the system SHALL refresh from external sources

### Requirement 5: Geospatial Query Capabilities

**User Story:** As a user, I want to find weather patterns for areas near my event location so that I can make informed decisions about venue selection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching for nearby data THEN the system SHALL use PostGIS spatial queries
2. WHEN querying by radius THEN the system SHALL return weather data within specified distance
3. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show distance from original location
4. WHEN no nearby data exists THEN the system SHALL expand search radius automatically
5. IF spatial queries fail THEN the system SHALL fallback to coordinate-based filtering

### Requirement 6: Database Schema and Migrations

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured database schema so that data integrity is maintained and the system can evolve over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating database schema THEN the system SHALL define proper table relationships and constraints
2. WHEN updating schema THEN the system SHALL use migration scripts for version control
3. WHEN storing coordinates THEN the system SHALL use appropriate precision for weather data accuracy
4. WHEN handling time zones THEN the system SHALL store all timestamps in UTC
5. IF migration fails THEN the system SHALL rollback changes and maintain data integrity

### Requirement 7: Performance and Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to respond quickly even with large amounts of stored data so that my experience remains smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying location data THEN the system SHALL use spatial indexes for sub-second response
2. WHEN searching by date THEN the system SHALL use temporal indexes for efficient filtering
3. WHEN cache grows large THEN the system SHALL implement automatic cleanup of expired entries
4. WHEN database reaches capacity THEN the system SHALL archive old data automatically
5. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide monitoring and alerting capabilities

### Requirement 8: Data Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a user, I want my event data to be secure and private so that my personal information is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing user data THEN the system SHALL use Supabase Row Level Security (RLS)
2. WHEN accessing data THEN the system SHALL authenticate users before allowing data access
3. WHEN transmitting data THEN the system SHALL use encrypted connections (SSL/TLS)
4. WHEN user requests deletion THEN the system SHALL completely remove their data
5. IF security breach occurs THEN the system SHALL have audit logs for investigation

### Requirement 9: Integration with Existing System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database integration to work seamlessly with the existing codebase so that current functionality is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue operating in stateless mode
2. WHEN integrating with FastAPI THEN the system SHALL use async database operations
3. WHEN connecting from React THEN the system SHALL use Supabase client for real-time features
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing APIs
5. IF integration conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL prioritize existing functionality

### Requirement 10: Monitoring and Maintenance

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor database health and performance so that I can ensure reliable service for users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring database THEN the system SHALL track connection pool usage and query performance
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging
3. WHEN maintenance is needed THEN the system SHALL provide tools for data cleanup and optimization
4. WHEN scaling is required THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling through Supabase
5. IF critical issues arise THEN the system SHALL send alerts to administrators
